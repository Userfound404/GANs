# GANs
### This repository contains collections of projects related to Generative Adversarial Networks

# 1. DCGAN(MNIST)

The GAN model was used to create new images of handwritten images

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Tensorflow 2.x
* SkLearn


## How to use

you can directly use the colab file - MNIST DATASET ([Notebook file](https://github.com/Userfound404/GANs/blob/main/DCGAN.ipynb)) [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z0zi2H2ZuHKN6EYM4caf_iQxWebIGEqx?usp=sharing)

you can find all the training images in the file DCGAN([here](https://github.com/Userfound404/GANs/tree/main/DCGAN))

## Output

# 2. Fashion MNIST

The ipynb sometimes fails to load in github, check out the colab file directly here - FASHION MNIST DATASET ([Notebook file](https://github.com/Userfound404/GANs/blob/main/GANs_fashion_MNIST.ipynb)) [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BsihcBngh4Ec0FYvPkzP1VadoFDdEr4n?usp=sharing)

The model was trained for very less number of epochs, training around 2000 would be producing noticable outputs.

A pre-trained model, that can be found in the file generatormodel.h5([here](https://github.com/Userfound404/GANs/blob/main/generatormodel.h5)) will produce the following output
